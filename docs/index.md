# What is "channel-driven" flooding?
Flood hazards in most basins are typically assumed to be driven by the frequency and intensity of high discharge events, but changes in a riverâ€™s conveyance capacity can also contribute substantially to flood hazards. Take the channel shown in the figure below where Q-bankfull is the bankfull flow capacity of the channel. This river section can flood by two mechanisms. 1: it can experience a discharge event 'Q' that exceeds Q-bankfull, or 2: sediment can deposit in the channel changing the channel's conveyance capacity and causing water to flow overbank for what was previously a Q-bankfull event. We are trying to understand these changes in conveyance capacity in order to improve flood risk predictions.
